        	<div style="width:800px;" align="left">
                <p>You can also invest in the housing market. Unlike a bank account, the return on a housing investment is variable - you are not sure how much it will be when you buy. Housing prices can go up and down.</p>
                <p>The return from a housing investment comes from a combination of rent, and the increase in the value of the property. However, there is always a chance that you can't find a tenant, or that the value of the property falls.</p>
                <p>On average, the return from a housing investment will be higher than the return from a bank account. If it wasn't, why would you ever invest in property? It would be better to take the safe option of a bank account.</p>

                <p>Things to be aware of in property investments include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are usually large taxes on purchasing property (e.g. stamp duty), which means you need more return before you break even.</li>
                        <li>Missing even a few weeks of rent because you cannot find a tennant is very expensive. You are better off reducing your rent by 5% rather than missing 3 weeks of rent.</li>
                        <li>Different properties will perform differently based on many different factors - just because the 'property market' returned 10%, doesn't mean every property did!</li>
                    </ul>
