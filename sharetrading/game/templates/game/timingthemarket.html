                <p>The share market is a third option available to you for investing. Like property investments, the share market is considered risky - share prices regularly go up and down. The share market is typically even more risky than property.</p>
                <p>The return from an investment in shares comes from the movements in the price of the shares, and dividends (which are a company's way of giving some of their cash profits back to shareholders).</p>
                <p>As mentioned above, the share market is even riskier than property. Therefore, on average it returns more than a property investment. Otherwise no investor would be willing to take on the additional risk!</p>

            <p>Things to be aware of in stockmarket investments include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Some stocks pay large dividends. Other stocks pay no dividends at all. One isn't necessarily better than the other - if a stock doesn't pay dividends, it's stock price is higher by what it would have paid in dividends. Regardless, it is good to know whether a company likes to give its profits back to shareholders, or whether it likes to reinvest the profits back into itself.</li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Reasons you might consider investing in stocks include:
                    <ul>
                      <li>You want high returns, and are willing to bear more risk to get them.</li>
                      <li></li>
                    </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Reasons you might consider a different investment instead include:
                <ul>
                    <li>You may need the money for other things in the near future. Even though you can buy and sell stocks quickly and cheaply, there is always the chance that a stock's price falls quickly. If you are forced to sell just after the stock's price falls, you may regret it.</li>
                    <li>You are investing for a short term only. Whilst on average stocks return more than savings accounts and property, they are also subject to much greater day-to-day fluctuations in value. A stock you buy could easily lose 5% or more in a week. If you are holding onto the stock for a long time, you minimise the effects of this up-and-down movement, but may not be able to in the short term.</li>
